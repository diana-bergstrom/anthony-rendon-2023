## Project Description

### Part 1

I created a visualization of Anthony Rendon's walk and strikeout rates by analyzing data obtained from [fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/anthony-rendon/12861/splits?position=3B&season=2023) from the first 26 games of the 2023 season using Python

Skills Used

* Python
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* readcsv()
* copy()
* isnull()
* any()
* str.replace()
* astype()
* loc()
* isin()
* rename()
* title()
* xlabel()
* xticks()
* savefig()

### Part 2

I performed data analysis using Python on data I collected from the first 26 games of the 2023 season to generate visualizations of the Los Angeles Angels' team statistics when Anthony Rendon leads off an inning

* to_datetime()
* sum()
* tick_params()
* mean()
* axhline()

## Conclusion

Anthony Rendon walks more and strikes out less when he is hitting with runners on the basepaths, and the Angels as a team have a higher average and on base percentage for the season than they do when Anthony Rendon leads off an inning
