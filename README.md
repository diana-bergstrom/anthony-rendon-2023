## Project Description

Analysis of basic hitting stats from the first 26 games of the Los Angeles Angels' 2023 MLB season using Python

### Part 1

Created a visualization of Anthony Rendon's walk and strikeout rates with data obtained from [fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/players/anthony-rendon/12861/splits?position=3B&season=2023)

Skills Used

* Python
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* readcsv()
* copy()
* isnull()
* any()
* str.replace()
* astype()
* loc()
* isin()
* rename()
* title()
* xlabel()
* xticks()
* savefig()

### Part 2

Created visualizations of the Los Angeles Angels' team statistics when Anthony Rendon leads off an inning with data from [fangraphs](https://www.fangraphs.com/teams/angels)

* to_datetime()
* sum()
* tick_params()
* mean()
* axhline()

## Summary of Analysis

Anthony Rendon walks more and strikes out less when he is hitting with runners on the basepaths. In comparison to the innings where Anthony Rendon leads off, the Angels team as a whole displays a higher season-long average for both batting average and on-base percentage. Therefore, Anthony Rendon should not be slotted as the leadoff hitter in the lineup in order to limit the amount of at bats he has where he leads off an inning.
